If not, search our <a href=https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues>issues list on GitHub</a> in case a similar issue has already been opened.</p> <p>It is very helpful if you can prepare a reproduction of the bug. In other words, provide a small test case which we can run to confirm your bug. It makes it easier to find the problem and to fix it. Test cases should be provided as curl commands which we can copy and paste into a terminal to run it locally, for example:</p> <pre class="highlight shell"><code><span class=c># delete the API</span>
curl -XDELETE 127.0.0.1:8001/apis/a2e8fccf-96b2-46c0-c6dd-4d0e968660b7

<span class=c># insert a new API</span>
curl -XPOST 127.0.0.1:8001/apis/
-d <span class=s1>'name=HttpBin'</span> <span class=se>\</span>
-d <span class=s1>'public_dns=api.httpbin.org'</span> <span class=se>\</span>
-d <span class=s1>'target_url=http://httbin.org'</span>

<span class=c># this should return XXXX but instead returns YYY</span>
curl ...
</code></pre> <p>Provide as much information as you can. You may think that the problem lies with your query, when actually it depends on how your data is stored. The easier it is for us to recreate your problem, the faster it is likely to be fixed.</p> <p><a href=https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/new class="button button-primary button-large">Report a Bug in Github</a></p> </div> </section> <section> <div class=container> <h2 id=feature-requests>Feature Requests</h2> <p>If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn’t exist in Kong, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Many of the features that Kong has today have been added because our users saw the need. Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/Mashape/kong/issues/new?title=[Feature%20Request]%20Your%20feature%20request%20here..." class="button button-primary button-large">Open an Issue in Github</a></p> </div> </section> <section> <div class=container> <h2 id=contributing-code-and-documentation-changes>Contributing code and documentation changes</h2> <p>If you have a bugfix or new feature that you would like to contribute to Kong, please find or open an issue about it first. Talk about what you would like to do. It may be that somebody is already working on it, or that there are particular issues that you should know about before implementing the change.</p> <p>We enjoy working with contributors to get their code accepted. There are many approaches to fixing a problem and it is important to find the best approach before writing too much code.</p> <p>The process for contributing to any of the Kong repositories is similar. Details for individual projects can be found below:</p> <hr> <h3 id=fork-and-clone-the-repository>Fork and clone the repository</h3> <p>You will need to fork the main Kong code or documentation repository and clone it to your local machine. See <a href=https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo>https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo</a> for help.</p> <p>Further instructions for specific projects are given below.</p> <hr> <h3 id=submitting-your-changes>Submitting your changes</h3> <p>Once your changes and tests are ready to submit for review:</p> <h4 id=1-test-your-changes>1. Test Your Changes</h4> <p>Run the test suite to make sure that nothing is broken.</p> <h4 id=2-sign-the-contributor-license-agreement>2. Sign the Contributor License Agreement</h4> <p>Please make sure you have signed our <a href=https://www.clahub.com/agreements/Mashape/kong>Contributor License Agreement</a>. We are not asking you to assign copyright to us, but to give us the right to distribute your code without restriction. We ask this of all contributors in order to assure our users of the origin and continuing existence of the code. You only need to sign the CLA once.</p> <h4 id=3-rebase-your-changes>3. Rebase Your Changes</h4> <p>Update your local repository with the most recent code from the main Kong repository, and rebase your branch on top of the latest master branch. We prefer your initial changes to be squashed into a single commit. Later, if we ask you to make changes, add them as separate commits. This makes them easier to review. As a final step before merging we will either ask you to squash all commits yourself or we’ll do it for you.</p> <h4 id=4-submit-a-pull-request>4. Submit a Pull Request</h4> <p>Update your local repository with the most recent code from the main Kong repository, and rebase your branch on top of the latest master branch. We prefer your initial changes to be squashed into a single commit. Later, if we ask you to make changes, add them as separate commits. This makes them easier to review. As a final step before merging we will either ask you to squash all commits yourself or we’ll do it for you.</p> <hr> <h3> <a href=# class=toggle-page-section>Contributing To Documentation</a> </h3> <div class=page-section> <p><strong>Repository</strong>: <a href=https://github.com/mashape/kong>https://github.com/mashape/kong</a> in the <code>/site/app/_includes/pages/</code> directory.</p> <p>The entire website is maintained on GitHub in the <code>site</code> folder. You can run it by following the instructions at <a href=https://github.com/Mashape/kong/blob/master/site/README.md>https://github.com/Mashape/kong/blob/master/site/README.md</a></p> <p>There is no need to create an issue for documentation changes. Summarising your changes in the pull request will suffice. Similarly, there are no documentation tests.</p> </div> <hr> <h3> <a href=# class=toggle-page-section>Contributing To Kong Codebase</a> </h3> <div class=page-section> <p><strong>Repository</strong>: <a href=https://github.com/mashape/kong>https://github.com/mashape/kong</a></p> <p>Make sure you have all the required dependencies installed, and that you understand how the Makefile works.</p> <p>Please follow these formatting guidelines:</p> <ul> <li>Lua indent is 2 spaces Line width is 140 characters</li> <li>The rest is left to Lua coding standards</li> <li>Disable &quot;auto-format on save&quot; to prevent unnecessary format changes. This makes reviews much harder as it generates unnecessary formatting changes. If your IDE supports formatting only modified chunks, that is fine to do.</li> </ul> <p>To create a distribution from the source, simply run:</p> <pre class="highlight shell"><code><span class=nb>cd </span>kong
make dev
</code></pre> <p>You will find the newly built development configuration under: ./config.dev/</p> <p>Before submitting your changes, run the test suite to make sure that nothing is broken, with:</p> <pre class="highlight shell"><code>make <span class=nb>test</span>-all
